              Governments around the world started to bomb their own people, whole cities wiped of the map within a matter of days. Its the only way possible they could reduce the spread of the infection. Within the first year "quarantine zones" were established in order to keep the remaining population safe, although there is often the spread of infection and internal uprises.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the quarantine zones created was in Chernogorsk, Chernarus. A once prosperous coast town. Now one of the last bastions of humanity.

                  Fungus grows in humans while they are still alive. The host will then go through four stages of infection, effectively turning its hosts into a zombie like state until it eventually kills them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The infection was caused by fungus evolving due to global temperature getting warmer, This caused the infection to withstand hotter temperatures in its host. The evolved fungus was then capable of burrowing into our brains and taking control of humans. This created billions of puppets with poisoned minds permanently fixed on one goal, to spread the infection to every last human alive. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong> There is no cure, there is no preventive measure humans can take to stop it.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The fungal infection is worse than death. The mutated Cordyceps fungus affects its host's neurons, kills brain cells, and assumes control of the motor functions.
                </p>

                  The quarantine zone is controlled by the “federal disaster response agency” (FEDRA). An <strong>"infection check"</strong> for any individuals that display symptoms of illness.
                  These individuals will be given 1 dose of medicine. If symptoms don't disappear, they are considered <strong>infected</strong> and will be inmediatly removed and terminated.
